# udacityMaps
Project for Udacity Web Front End 

## How-To:

### Run:
Install the files in the dist/ on a remote web server or run localy. For example use ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` and you should then see:
```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```
It means the server is up and running on your computer on port 8000. You can type http://localhost:8000/ into the address of a web browser to see the web site.

### Use:

### Build:
Use ```grunt``` to get the processed files in ```/dist``` based on the source in ```/src```.
The first time, from a terminal, navigate at the root of the project, where ```gruntfile.js``` is and type ```npm install```. This will read the ```pacakage.json``` files and install all the grunt dependencies you need.
